Using machine learning to understand customers behavior

## Problem statement
One of the most common financial decisions that each of
us makes on a nearly daily basis involves the purchasing
of various products, goods, and services. In some cases the
decision on whether or not to make a purchase is based
largely on price but in many instances the purchasing decision is 
more complex, with many more considerations affecting the 
decision-making process before the final commitment is made. 
Retailers understand this well and attempt to make use of it in an 
effort to gain an edge in a highly competitive market. 


The goal of the present work is to examine using data driven
machine learning, whether specific objective and readily measurable factors 
influence customersâ€™ decisions.


### Dataset collection
For the present work data were collected from kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akram24/mall-customers.
In order to perform the experiments, dataset should be stored into a pandas dataframe 

### Data exploration
It is crucial to xplore the data to check the quality of the data and the distribution of the variables
* check that if there is any missing value
* check if there are duplicated rows
* check the type of categorical variables
* check information and statistics
* check correlation between the variables
